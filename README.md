SQL Project on WSDA Music Database
Hi! ðŸ‘‹
This is a SQL project I worked on using SQLite and the WSDA Music Database. The goal was to explore and apply various SQL concepts through hands-on practice.

WHAT I DID
> In this project, I performed a wide range of operations on tables like Customer, Invoice, Tracks, and more. Here are some of the key things I worked on:
> Cleaned and filtered raw data
> Grouped data and used aggregation functions like AVG, SUM, and COUNT
> Wrote subqueries to simplify complex logic
> Created views to save reusable queries
> Used SQL date and time functions
> Applied DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to manipulate the data

SQL CONCEPTS USED
Some of the key SQL features I practiced:

> SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
> JOIN operations (including LEFT OUTER JOIN)
> CASE statements
> CREATE VIEW
> Date and time functions like DATE() and DATETIME()
> Subqueries (queries inside other queries)
> Aliasing using AS to make results more readable

How to Run
Clone or download this repository
Open the wsda_music.db file in DB Browser for SQLite
Go to the Execute SQL tab and try running the queries from the SQL files Iâ€™ve added

WHAT I LEARNED!

This project really helped me understand how to:

> Write cleaner, more efficient SQL queries
> Handle and clean messy data
> Use grouping and aggregation to get insights
> Work with dates and times in SQL
> Break down complex queries using subqueries and views
